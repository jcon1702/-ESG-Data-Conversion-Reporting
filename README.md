# ESG Data Conversion & Reporting

An end‚Äëto‚Äëend Excel/Google Sheets solution to convert hardcopy ESG records into actionable dashboards and reports.

---

## üìò Background

TotalEnergies Vietnam has recently completed a major ESG data collection campaign‚Äîfrom recycled oil reports to solar plant performance‚Äîmost of which still exists in hardcopy or mixed formats. To support weekly reporting and strategic decision‚Äëmaking, we need to:

* Digitize all historical ESG records

* Clean & normalize mixed‚Äêformat data (dates, units, missing values)

* Visualize key KPIs in interactive dashboards

* Generate concise reports for PMs and the Board

This mock project demonstrates a repeatable workflow to transform raw OCR‚Äëstyle input into polished deliverables.

## üéØ Objective

1. Convert scanned & inconsistent ESG records into a standardized Excel table

2. Clean and impute missing/erroneous values for energy consumption, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and waste generated

3. Aggregate metrics by day and by week using PivotTables

4. Visualize trends with charts and slicers on a Dashboard sheet

5. Summarize key insights and recommendations in a PowerPoint report

## ‚úÖ Conclusions & Next Steps

* Success: Achieved full digitization and reliable dashboards in under one week

* Insight: Energy spikes on maintenance days; CO‚ÇÇ correlates strongly with energy usage

* Recommendations:
  
  * Automate OCR workflow (e.g. Power Automate)

  * Extend to Power BI for real‚Äëtime monitoring

  * Integrate with corporate ESG portal for quarterly reporting
